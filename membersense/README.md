## Prerequisites for Users

To use the MemberSense Discord Integration in production mode, you need to set up your own Discord bot. Follow the steps below to create and configure your bot.

### Discord Bot Setup Guide

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click on "New Application" and give your application a name.
3. Click the "Bot" tab in the left sidebar. Click "Add Bot" if you don't have one yet.
4. Under the bot's username, click "Copy" to copy your bot token. Keep this token secret and secure.
5. Scroll down to the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section and enable all the checkboxes ("Presence Intent", "Server Members Intent" and "Message Content Intent").

Note: The OAuth2 URL generation is primarily for inviting the bot to a server. If you're adding the bot to your own server or have other means of adding it, you may skip steps 6-9.

6. To invite the bot to your server, go to the "OAuth2" tab in the left sidebar.

7. In the "Scopes" section, select "bot" and you'll see these checkboxes:

8. In the "Bot Permissions" section under OAuth2, select the following permissions:
   - View Channels
   - View Server Insights
   - Send Messages
   - Read Message History
-->

6. Under left side nav "OAuth2" add a Redirect URL and select that URL in a subsequent step.

http://localhost:8887/feed/#members=discord


7. Under left side nav "OAuth2 > OAuth2 URL Generator > Scopes", select these scopes:

**Required Scopes:**
- `bot` - If you're creating a bot application (most common for this use case)
- `guilds` - Required to see which servers your bot/app has access to
- `guilds.members.read` - Required to read member information from servers

**Additional Scopes (for channel/message features):**
- `messages.read` - If you need to read message history (requires additional bot permissions)


8. After selecting scopes, the "Bot Permissions" section will appear. Select these permissions:

**Required Bot Permissions:**
- View Channels
- View Server Insights
- Send Messages  
- Read Message History

The permissions integer generated should be: **592896**

<!--
Also tried this without success:
In Discord, found the bot user, went to its profile, clicked Add App > Add to Server, selected the server and clicked Authorize.

If true (valid), include this text:
Additional base permissions might be needed depending on your specific use case.
-->


9. Copy the generated OAuth2 URL and open it in a new browser tab. Select the server where you want to add the bot and click "Authorize".

10. **Important**: After authorization, you should have "Manage Server" permission on the server to access all bot features.

## Environment Configuration

The Discord bot token must be configured in **two places**:

1. **Backend Configuration**: `membersense/backend/.env`
   ```
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   ```

2. **Frontend Configuration**: `feed/.env` (root level)
   ```
   VITE_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/
   ```


For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [official Discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html).


## Installation for Developers

To get started with the MemberSense Discord Integration frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ModelEarth/feed.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd feed
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

### Backend Server

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd membersense/backend
   ```

2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   bun run src/server.js
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

### Frontend Development

1. Navigate back to the feed root:
   ```bash
   cd ../..
   ```

2. For development, build and serve:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   python -m http.server 8887
   ```
   Then visit: `http://localhost:8887/feed/#members=discord`

**Note**: Avoid `yarn dev` - Use `yarn build` instead for proper integration with Discord API and hash-driven navigation.
