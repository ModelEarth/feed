# Discord Bot Backend Design Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for a Discord bot backend service using Bun as the runtime. The service provides a RESTful API for managing Discord bot interactions, supporting multiple users and bots simultaneously.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Language**: JavaScript
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `discord.js`: For Discord API interactions
  - `nanoid`: For generating unique session IDs

## 3. Architecture

The backend follows a simple, stateless architecture with in-memory session management:

```
[Client] <--> [Bun Server] <--> [Discord API]
                  |
          [In-Memory Session Store]
```

- The Bun server handles incoming HTTP requests.
- Sessions are managed in-memory for simplicity and performance.
- Each authenticated session corresponds to a unique Discord bot instance.

## 4. API Endpoints

### Authentication

- **POST /api/auth/login**
  - Purpose: Initialize a bot session
  - Request Body: `{ "token": "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" }`
  - Response: `{ "sessionId": "UNIQUE_SESSION_ID", "message": "Logged in successfully" }`

- **POST /api/auth/logout**
  - Purpose: Terminate a bot session
  - Headers: `Authorization: SESSION_ID`
  - Response: `{ "message": "Logged out successfully" }`

### Discord Data Retrieval

- **GET /api/members**
  - Purpose: Fetch guild members
  - Headers: `Authorization: SESSION_ID`
  - Response: Array of member objects

- **GET /api/channels**
  - Purpose: Fetch guild channels
  - Headers: `Authorization: SESSION_ID`
  - Response: Array of channel objects

- **GET /api/messages**
  - Purpose: Fetch messages from a specific channel
  - Headers: `Authorization: SESSION_ID`
  - Query Parameters: 
    - `channelId`: ID of the channel to fetch messages from
    - `limit`: (optional) Number of messages to fetch (default: 100)
  - Response: Array of message objects

## 5. Security Considerations

- Bot tokens are stored server-side and never sent back to the client.
- Session IDs are used for authentication after initial login.
- CORS headers are implemented to control access to the API.
- All routes (except login) require a valid session ID for authentication.

## 6. Error Handling

- The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios:
  - 200: Successful operations
  - 400: Bad requests (e.g., invalid input)
  - 401: Unauthorized access
  - 404: Resource not found
  - 500: Internal server errors

- Error responses include a JSON body with an `error` field describing the issue.

## 7. Logging

- The server logs all incoming requests, including method, URL, and associated session ID.
- Additional logging is implemented for error scenarios and important events (e.g., session creation/destruction).

## 8. Scalability Considerations

- The current implementation uses in-memory session storage, which is not suitable for distributed environments.
- For production scenarios, consider implementing:
  - Distributed session storage (e.g., Redis)
  - Load balancing for handling increased traffic
  - Rate limiting to prevent API abuse

## 9. Testing

- Implement unit tests for individual functions (e.g., authentication, data fetching).
- Create integration tests to verify API endpoint behavior.
- Perform load testing to ensure the server can handle multiple concurrent users.

## 10. Deployment

- The server can be deployed using Bun's built-in server capabilities.
- Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) for easier deployment and scaling.
- Implement proper environment variable management for sensitive data (e.g., default bot tokens, if any).

## 11. Future Enhancements

- Implement webhook support for real-time Discord events.
- Add support for sending messages and performing other Discord actions.
- Develop a companion frontend application for easier bot management.

## 12. Conclusion

This Discord bot backend provides a flexible and efficient solution for managing multiple Discord bots through a RESTful API. By leveraging Bun's performance and modern JavaScript features, it offers a solid foundation for building Discord bot applications.
