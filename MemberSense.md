## Prerequisites for Users

To use the MemberSense Discord Integration in production mode, you need to set up your own Discord bot. Follow the steps below to create and configure your bot.

### Discord Bot Setup Guide

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click on "New Application" and give your application a name.
3. Click the "Bot" tab in the left sidebar. Click "Add Bot" if you don't have one yet.
4. Under the bot's username, click "Copy" to copy your bot token. Keep this token secret and secure.
5. Scroll down to the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section and enable all the checkboxes ("Presence Intent", "Server Members Intent" and "Message Content Intent").
6. To invite the bot to your server, go to the "OAuth2" tab in the left sidebar.
7. In the "Scopes" section, select "bot" and you'll see these checkboxes:

8. In the "Bot Permissions" section under OAuth2, select the following permissions:
   - View Channels
   - View Server Insights
   - Send Messages
   - Read Message History
<!-- Probably leave as "Guide Install" -->

<!--
Also tried this without success:
In Discord, found the bot user, went to its profile, clicked Add App > Add to Server, selected the server and clicked Authorize.
-->

9. Copy the generated URL at the bottom of the page. (Contains permissions integer: 592896)
10. Open a new browser tab, paste the URL, and select the server <!-- model.earth for us --> where you want to add the bot.

Note: The OAuth2 URL generation is primarily for inviting the bot to a server. If you're adding the bot to your own server or have other means of adding it, you may skip steps 6-10.

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [official Discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html).

### Required Bot Permissions

Ensure your bot has the following permissions:

- View Channels
- View Server Insights
- Send Messages
- Read Message History

Additional base permissions might be needed depending on your specific use case.
